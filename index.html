<h3>EDUCATION</h3>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Masters' In Advanced Robotics and Masters' in Robotics Engineeering | Ecole Centrale de Nantes and University of Genoa </h4></li>
  <p>
    Being a EMARO+ (European MAsters' in Advanced Robotics) Scholar, I have been given the chance to school in two leading universities in Europe to study robotics.
    My interest in robotics revolves around sustainability and improving every chance of survival humans have on earth. This involves robots for health, sustainable
    and progressive purposes. My preferred areas of research include biomedical robotics, virtual reality and robot interactivity, and agriculture.
  </p>
  <li><h4>Foundation Masters' in Control and Robotics | Ecole Centrale de Nantes</h4></li>
  <p>
    The foundation master’s course was taken in order to build skills not formerly acquired or nurtured through
    the first degree, and introduce myself to new concepts in a new country. All important papers were passed
    with good marks.
  </p>
  <li><h4>B.Eng. Mechanical Engineering</h4></li>
  <p>
    Successfully completed B.Eng. in mechanical engineering with a 4.5/5 (90%, First Class Honors), from one of
    Africa’s leading universities. Course work involved leadership, entrepreneurial and ethics courses, speaking
    for the confidence in my ability to be a productive team member, and in any given case, team leader. The
    final project was done on electroless and electrolytic nickel coatings, of which a review paper on corrosion
    prevention using electroless coatings had been recently published.

  <h3>Books and Reading</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I have never written a book</li>
    <li>I've read some science, math, and computer development books. Here's a list of my likes:</li>
    <p>The cyberpunk genre is still good to me: Ready player one, Snow Crash, Technomancer</p>
    <p>High fantasy is pretty good: Mistborn, LOTR, Name of the Wind stuff, The Lies of Locke Lamora</p>
    <p>Right now I'm engoying some math and physics books, and engaging in nonfiction</p>
