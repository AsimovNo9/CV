      <p>A Robotics Engineer with a double degree master's in Control and Robotics: Advanced Robotics at ECN, France and Robotics Engineering at the University of Genoa, Italy. Generally, I have a strong learning drive and love to engage in everything from the arts to the sciences.</p>
      <p>I hope to be able to build a list of skills and implement them creatively. Being a computer and hardware nerd, I walk the path of various life projects, and this includes tweaking around with some parts, developing software and games, messing around with robots</p>

<h3>EDUCATION</h3>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Masters' In Advanced Robotics and Masters' in Robotics Engineeering | Ecole Centrale de Nantes and University of Genoa </h4></li>
  <p>
    Being a EMARO+ (European Masters' in Advanced Robotics) Scholar, I have been given the chance to school in two leading universities in Europe to study robotics.
    My interest in robotics revolves around sustainability and improving every chance of survival humans have on earth. This involves robots for health, sustainable
    and progressive purposes. My preferred areas of research include perception and navigation, and field of implementation would be Agriculture if chanced.
  </p>
  <li><h4>Foundation Masters' in Control and Robotics | Ecole Centrale de Nantes</h4></li>
  <p>
    The foundation master’s course was taken in order to build skills not formerly acquired or nurtured through
    the first degree, and introduce myself to new concepts in a new country. All important papers were passed
    with good marks.
  </p>
  <li><h4>B.Eng. Mechanical Engineering</h4></li>
  <p>
    Successfully completed B.Eng. in mechanical engineering with a 4.5/5 (90%, First Class Honors), from one of
    Africa’s leading universities. Course work involved leadership, entrepreneurial and ethics courses, speaking
    for the confidence in my ability to be a productive team member, and in any given case, team leader. The
    final project was done on electroless and electrolytic nickel coatings, of which a review paper on corrosion
    prevention using electroless coatings had been recently published.

  <h3>Books and Reading</h3>
  <ul>

    <li>I have never written a book, but I have written two theses:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Electroless and Electrolytic Coating of Mild Steel</li>
      <li>Deep Learning Object Detection and Tracking of Screws in an Automated Recycling Process</li>
    </ul>

    <li>I've read some science, math, and computer development books. Here's a list of my likes:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The cyberpunk genre is still good to me: Ready player one, Snow Crash, Technomancer</li>
        <li>High fantasy is pretty good: Mistborn, LOTR, Name of the Wind stuff, The Lies of Locke Lamora</li>
        <li>Right now I'm enjoying some math and physics books, and engaging in nonfiction</li>
        <li>Job searching, so learning some datastructures and algorithms, and refreshing my python</li>
      </ul>
